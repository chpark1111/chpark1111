I'm Chanhyeok Park, highly self-motivated undergraduate student at KAIST, School of Computing.  

Currently, I am in **KAIST Geometry & AI Lab** advised by [Prof. Minhyuk Sung](https://mhsung.github.io/).   

My research interests are in deep learning without human supervision like ***unsupervised learning***, ***reinforcement learning*** and ***generative models***. Check out my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RfsIVpIltg7FVfvjILf7h9kHHvhOP3x_/view?usp=sharing) for more.
