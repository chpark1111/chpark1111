I am Chanhyeok Park, an ambitious and self-driven undergraduate student at the KAIST School of Computing. 

My academic interests lie at the intersection of Intellectual Property (IP) law, deep learning, 3D computer vision, and LLMs. 

Currently, my primary focus is exploring how advanced deep learning methodologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), can be effectively applied to Legal Technology, aiming to drive meaningful innovation in the legal domain .
