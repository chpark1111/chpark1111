I'm Chanhyeok Park, highly self-motivated undergraduate student at KAIST, School of Computing.  

Currently, I am in **KAIST Geometry & AI Lab** advised by [Prof. Minhyuk Sung](https://mhsung.github.io/).   

My research interests are in deep learning without human supervision like ***unsupervised learning***, ***reinforcement learning*** and ***generative models***. Currently, I'm focusing on 3D computer vision and geometry processing with deep learning to develop an A.I. system that can be later embedded into 3D graphics/ software.
