I'm Chanhyeok Park, highly self-motivated undergraduate student at KAIST, School of Computing. Currently, I am in **KAIST Geometry & AI Lab** under supervision of [Prof. Minhyuk Sung](https://mhsung.github.io/). My research interests are in deep learning without human supervision like ***unsupervised learning***, ***reinforcement learning*** and ***generative models***.
