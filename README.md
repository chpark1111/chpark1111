I'm Chanhyeok Park, highly self-motivated undergraduate student at KAIST, School of Computing.  

Currently, I am in **KAIST Geometry & AI Lab** advised by [Prof. Minhyuk Sung](https://mhsung.github.io/).   

My research goal is to enable computers to understand 3D shapes by simple geometric parts and the consequence of geometric operations applied to 3D shapes. Currently, I'm focusing on 3D computer vision and geometry processing with deep learning to develop an A.I. system that can be later embedded into 3D graphics/CAD software.
