I'm Chanhyeok Park, highly self-motivated undergraduate student at KAIST, School of Computing.  

Currently, I am in **KAIST Geometry & AI Lab** advised by [Prof. Minhyuk Sung](https://mhsung.github.io/) and [Schperics Inc.](https://www.schperics.com/) as a quant researcher.

I want to combine my knowledge of deep learning to various fields like **computer vision, reinforcement learning, finance and law**.
