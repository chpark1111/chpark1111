I'm Chanhyeok Park, highly self-motivated undergraduate student at KAIST, School of Computing.  

Currently, I am in **KAIST Geometric AI Lab** advised by [Prof. Minhyuk Sung](https://mhsung.github.io/).

I want to combine my knowledge of deep learning to various fields like **computer vision, reinforcement learning, finance, medicine, law and music**.
